Goal: To Complete all Linux must to learn topics: Linux File System, Navigation, users, groups, permisssions.


In Linux OS, Everything starts from /

pwd 		--> print working directory
cd			--> Change Direcory
cd ..		--> One step back in the path
ls			--> List everything in present directory

bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  local  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var


/ (Root Directory) : Top level directory, The parent of all other directories in Linux OS. (c:\)

/root : (Root users home directory) : Root users private nworkspace. (c:\users\Administrator)

/home : User's home directory : Home direcotry of all non-root users. If you create a user, you will get a directory for him automatically.

/bin (Binary Executables) : Contains essential binary files used by all users. (eg: ls, mv, cp...).. We use these in basic system operations.. 

/boot (Boot Loader Files) : Contains Linux Kernel and boot configuration and supported files. 

/dev (Device Files) : Contains files that represents harware devices i.e; hard disks (Similar to windows Device manager).. 

/etc (Configuration Files) : Sores system level configuration files.. User password, os info, dns info.. 

/var (Variable Files) : Contains data that changes frequently (Db, logs, web content)


---


/usr (User Programs) : Contains user level programs and libraries.. 

/sbin (System Binaries) : Contains system admin comamnds (ifconfig, iptables, firewall).. Only root and superusers can use these commands.

/mnt (Mount points) : Temporaty mount points for system. 

/media (Removable MEdia) : us, cd.. 

/proc (Process information) : Process inforamtion

/lib and /lib64 (Library files) : Contains shared libraries, that can be used by multiple programs. (similar to windows .dll)

/opt (Optional Software) : Contains optional 3rd part softwares and add-ons.

EBS : Elastic Block Storage : Block Based Storage.. 

IOPS : Input and output operations per second.

Storage : 
Block Size : Size of the data blocks being read/write. 4 kb / 8 KB.
Latency : Time taken to process a single I/O operation
Throughput : Mb/S

IOPS Formula :

IOPS = Throughput x 1024 / BlockSize
400 x 1024 / 8 = 51200 IOPS

root volume : Contqains Operating System.. : gp2, gp3, io1, io2, magnetic.. 

SSD : Solid state drive : Latest and better performance.. : gp2, gp3, io1, io2..

General purpose SSD : gp2, gp3.. Most common workloads.. We can get max of 16,000 IOPS only..
gp2 : 3 IOPS per GB, with minimum of 100 IOPS.. 100 gb = 300 iops.. Min size : 1 GB.. Max 16 TB
gp3 : Can adjust required IOPS count.. Min size : 1 GB.. Max 16 TB

Provisioned IOPS SSD : io1, io2.. Best performance.. Workloads that requires specific IOPS or exceeding 16,000 IOPS.. Min size : 4 GB.. Max 16 TB


HDD : Harddisk drive : older generation.. Less performance compared to SSD.. : sc1 and st1

Throughpout Optimised HDD (st1): Suitable for big data, data warehousing, log processing.. Min size : 125 GB.. Max 16 TB
Cold HDD (sc1) : Same as ST1, but less perf with less cost.. Min size : 125 GB.. Max 16 TB

Magnetic (standard): low-cost storage solutions.. outdated.. Less frequently accessed..  Min size : 1 GB.. Max 1 TB..

df -Th : Lists Storage devices detected and used by OS.. It displays Temp volumes as well.

nvme1n1

path : /dev/nvme1n1		--> 1 gb volume

mkdir newvol/


mkfs -t xfs /dev/nvme1n1



mount /dev/nvme1n1 newvol/

when we did mount operation.. We have to add an entry in "/etc/fstab" file..

After performing temporary mount, you get an entry in "/etc/mtab"" file. 
Get the entry information from "/etc/mtab" and write same to "/etc/fstab"..

/dev/nvme1n1 /home/ec2-user/newvol xfs rw,seclabel,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,sunit=8,swidth=8,noquota 0 0

volume should have file system.. 

Windows : NTFS, FAT32, ReFs
Linux : ext3, ext4, xfs..

---

Increase an Existing EBS volume size.. 

1. Increase it in AWS console.. 

xfs_growfs -d /home/ec2-user/newvol

2. Then run "xfs_growfs" command to increase the size.

In increase a specific partition.. use "growpart" command..

growpart /dev/nvme0n1 1


---

mount -o remount,size=4G /tmp

/etc/fstab write an entry for /tmp size

tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,size=4G 0 0
